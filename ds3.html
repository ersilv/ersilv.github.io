				<p class="py-3 text-red-500">Whenever I have time I try to come up with new ideas and improved versions of existing ones. I am, by no means, a professional analyst and the work presented here should not be taken as a professional analysis.</p>
				
				<p class="py-3">The objective of this post is to analyze event data of a soccer game and come up with useful metrics and insights to help understand the game. For this, we use the event data to create passing networks, defensive areas, shots and outcomes map, goals and expected goals. More techniques may be added in the future as I explore the data in more depth.</p>
				
				<p class="py-3">All data used in this post is provided by StatsBomb Services Ltd ("StatsBomb"). StatsBomb makes the data freely available and accessible to encourage and facilitate research and the shared analytical understanding of the game. It is important to note that any analysis or conclusions that are created and presented here as a result of using this data are not the opinions or analytical insights of StatsBomb.</p>
				
				<p class="py-3">The data is provided as a series of json files covering competitions, matches, lineups and events. The competitions file list all covered competitions with and their corresponding seasons. Each season of a competition has it's own file listing all the games, the result, the managers, and more. For each match, there is a corresponding events file, describing all events that occurred in the game, and a lineup files, listing the players. Bellow is an example of a mapped event, a ground pass between Iniesta and Messi.</p>

				<p class="py-3">The data used here covers the events of the 2018-2019 UEFA Champions League Finals between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool. The game ended with a Liverpool win by 2-0, with a penalty converted by Salah at the 2 minutes mark and a goal by substitute Origi at the end, around the 87th minute. </p> 
								
				<p class="py-6 font-bold">Passing Network</p>
				<p class="py-3">Passing Networks are a type of network analysis that has been used in football in the last years to understand what happens inside the pitch during a game. These network show the most important passing connections between the players, the intensity of these passing connections and the average position where the player make the pass.</p>
				
				<p class="py-3">In soccer, the network represents the players as the nodes in the graph, and the connections between the nodes are a representation of the intensity of the passes between the players. In this example, the players positions in the map are the average position where they made the passes in the game. It is also common to use the average position they received the passes or a fixed position represented by their role. The size of the nodes represents the number of passes the player made, while the thickness and the color of the connections represents the total number of pass between the pair of players.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<img src="img/DS3/Liverpool.png" class="h-full w-full rounded-t" oncontextmenu="return false;">
					<figcaption class="text-center">Liverpool passing network.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p class="py-3">In other cases, for more advanced analysis, the size of the nodes can represent other metrics for qualifying the value of the passes and the players impact in possession, goal and pass link, such as VAEP (valuing actions by estimating probabilities), xT (expected threat), PV (possession value), EPV (expected possession value), g+ (goals added). Some also try to show the specific type of pass, such as 'long pass', 'side pass', 'back pass'. Other metrics like pass accuracy, effective possession time, amount of pass per minute of possession, average length and direction of passes can also be used.</p>
				
				<p class="py-3">It's also possible to incorporate some network related metrics. Closeness can measure the minimum number of steps the ball has to undergo from on player to reach another one, showing how well connected are players inside the team. Betweenness centrality can account for many times a given player is necessary for completing the route connecting any two players, showing how crucial the players is to maintain passing connections. Clustering coefficient can measure the number of close players that also have passed the ball between them, showing the number of passing triangles created by the players.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<img src="img/DS3/Hotspur.png" class="h-full w-full rounded-t" oncontextmenu="return false;">
					<figcaption class="text-center">Hotspur passing network.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p class="py-3">This networks can also be used to compare the dynamics of the team between different stages of the game, such as before and after a substitution, before and after a tactical shift, between the 2 halves of a game, before and after a goal is scored. This can help analyses the impact of a substitution and if the player was able to change the flow of the game, how the team acted after taking or scoring a goal.</p>
				
				<p class="py-3">In the images above, we can see how Liverpool played, playing mainly through the left side of their attack, specially with Andrew Robertson and Sadio Mané. On the other hand, Hotspur had more trouble to make the transition between the defense and the attack, The majority of their passes were between the goalkeeper and the two central defenders.</p>
				
				<p class="py-6 font-bold">Defensive Area</p>
				<p class="py-3">Defensive maps are a way to show where the players most important defensive contributions lies. With this, it is possible to get an idea of the regions of the pitch the player usually operates, and remove defensive actions that may have been made because the players was in a wrong tactical position during the game. By Calculating defensive maps for all the players, we can see how they defend as a team.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/DS3/liverpool_defense.png" class="h-full w-full rounded-t" oncontextmenu="return false;">
					<figcaption class="text-center">Liverpool defensive area.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="py-3">To calculate the defensive map, we look at all the defensive actions the player took, such as interceptions, blocks, clearances, saves, among others, that resulted in a possession switch or foul. First we calculate the average position of a player defensive actions and remove all actions that fall too far away. In this example, we took out all actions that fall outside one standard deviation in both directions left/right across the pitch and up/down the pitch. We, then, calculate the convex hull with the core defensive actions positions, resulting in the players defensive hull.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/DS3/hotspur_defense.png" class="h-full w-full rounded-t" oncontextmenu="return false;">
					<figcaption class="text-center">Hotspur defensive area.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="py-3">In the example above, it is interesting to note is that Son, despite being an attacker, playing as left wing, has a lot of defensive contributions. He is always helping the defense during the opponents corners or free kicks, having as much contributions as the center back. His only other defensive action in the game was near the opponent area, and was removed for being an outlier.</p>
				
				<p class="py-6 font-bold">Goals and Expected Goals (xG)</p>
				<p class="py-3">In a low-scoring game such as football, final match score does not provide a clear picture of performance. Expected Goals (xG) was created with the purpose of measuring the quality of the goalscoring chances created and conceded by each team.</p>
				<p class="py-3">This metric is created by mapping the points of each shot and, internalizing them in an extensive databases, measuring the probability of goals being scored. A xG model takes into consideration a number of variables that affect the likelihood of a goal being scored, such as: distance of the shot; part of the body used to perform it (head, foot, other); type of play (open play, free kick, corner kick, counter attack, throw-in); type of assist (cross, cut back, pass); among others.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/DS3/hotspur_liverpool.png" class="h-full w-full rounded-t" oncontextmenu="return false;">
					<figcaption class="text-center">Hotspur vs Liverpool goals and expected goals (xG).</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="py-3">The Expected Goals metric can be used in different ways: to indicate a players/teams shooting ability (or luck), by comparing their total xG with the number of converted goals; the allowed xG can show a team's ability to prevent scoring opportunities by limiting the opponent of taking high probability shots.</p>
				<p class="py-3">Another way the expected values can be used is by plotting the xG values along the timeline of the game, creating a Expected Goals Plot. xGPlots make it possible to illustrate the narrative of the game in a chronological order, not only the amount and the quality of the shots are important, but also when they occur.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/DS3/xgplot.png" class="h-full w-full rounded-t"
					oncontextmenu="return false;">
					<figcaption class="text-center">Expected Goals Plot illustrating the game's narrative in chronological order.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p class="py-3">The xGPlot above show us that after receiving a goal in the first minute, Tottenham was unable to create more than one chance during the first half of the game. However, in the second half of the game, Tottenham was able to create 12 goalscoring opportunities. Liverpool started the game with a goal at the 1 minute mark, but after that didn't (nor did they necessarily needed to) create as much quality scoring chances as their opponent.</p>
								
				<p class="py-6 font-bold">Shots and Outcomes</p>
				<p class="py-3 text-red-500">Coming soon.</p>
				<p class="py-3">Another way of using the data to analyze the game is by plotting the shots and their outcomes. This gives way more context to the match than simple statistics about how many shots each team had.</p>
